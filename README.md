# OxRAM_NLP
This is the NLP section for the robotic arm

The goal is to build a real-time speech recognization model, which is based on OpenAI Whisper.

The first stage is to build the audio IO and the audio-to-text file. This is done in the audio_recog.py.

The second stage is about information extraction(IE). Check this in stage2 folder.

The third stage is visualization and building a virtual chessboard.

The fourth stage is to set up the api for the whole project. Possibly achieved by interative website.
